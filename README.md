# How-to-Turn-the-Black-Box-into-a-Transparent-Box
A collection of papers that try to turn the black box of deep learning into a transparent box.

The motivations are as follows: "**A main criticism against deep learning is that it is used as a black-box: even though it produces outstanding results, we know very little about how such results are derived internally. In bioinformatics, particularly in biomedical domains, it is notenough to simply produce good outcomes. Since many studiesare connected to patientsâ€™ health, it is crucial to change the black-box into the white-box (transparent box) providing logical reasoning just asclinicians do for medical treatments.**"" (Min, Seonwoo, Byunghan Lee, and Sungroh Yoon.
